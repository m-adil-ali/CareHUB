## Key Features

### 1. **AI Chatbot with ODPARA Technique**

- Utilizes the ODPARA (Onset, Duration, Progression,  Aggravating factors, Relieving, Anything else) methodology to extract detailed patient history.
- Provides a conversational interface for capturing patient symptoms and other critical information.

### 2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework**

- Employs a vector database to store and retrieve treatment information.
- Trains the database using:
  - Real-time patient interactions with doctors.
  - Medical books and professional resources used by doctors.
- Converts patient symptoms into embeddings and matches them with relevant treatments.

### 3. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**

- Processes retrieved data and generates human-readable medical recommendations.
- Ensures personalized and context-aware suggestions tailored to the patient’s needs.

### 4. **Physician Review and Approval**

- All AI-generated recommendations are forwarded to licensed physicians for review.
- Physicians can verify or modify the recommendations to ensure alignment with patient-specific requirements.
